## RoadMap

These are things I am likely to work on in the near future.

**General**
1. Define a Time Scale + Simulation Speeds.
2. Create a separate debug view.

**AI Library**
1. Build Debug View

**Planets**
1. Realistic Planet Data (geology/mass/size).
2. Planet Resources randomly placed at locations on planet.
3. Factories produce based on resources available on planet.

**Ships**
1. Ships have a fuel system.

## Design Goals

These are things that don't make sense to do in the near future, but I would like the game to have.

**General**
1. Procedural Worldgen.
2. Simulated in-game personalities.
3. Multiple systems + System exploration.

**Economy**
1. Organically simulated companies (e.g. can expand to new resources when they have money).

**Ships**
1. Simulated Crew.
2. Simulated Components (e.g. sensors/engines/weapons).

**Planets**
1. Generated Terrain (a grid of coordinate points, each point having some 'type').
2. Generated Planet Resources.
3. Planet Resources determined by Planet's geological make-up. 
4. Factories produce based on resource extraction on planet.

**Game Play**
1. Placeholder

## Interaction Draftboard

These are snapshots of messages + choices the user sees that correlate with the game vision.
They are intended as weak landmarks to steer game development in the right direction, as well as
serving as lore or flavour inspiration.

**Unidentified Ship Detected**

A screen flashes and beeps for your attention. An unexpected vessel has been picked
up on your passive sensors, however the System Atlas does not show any vessel in that area, for
reasons unknown they are flying dark. They are 0.78AU distant heading in your direction.
The drive signature is unknown to you, but it seems to be on the smaller side.

1. Ignore them.
2. Ping them for identification.
3. Scan them with active sensors.
4. Set course for intercept.
5. Engage with missiles.
